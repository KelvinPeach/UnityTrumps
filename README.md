![Gameplay Preview](https://github.com/KelvinPeach/UnityTrumps/blob/main/preview.jpg "Gameplay Preview")

Unity Trumps is an open-source trumps card game. The goal is to have all the cards. To gain cards, you must have the highest stat on each turn.

## Requirements
* Unity 2020.3 LTS or newer

## Getting Started
* Clone the project
* Open the project with Unity 2020.3 LTS or newer
* Open the game scene
* Press the play button

## Improvements
* Let the player choose a deck.
* The computer should take into account that sometimes a lower value is better when choosing a stat.
* The computer should take into account the relative value of the stat. For example, at the moment given the two stats ferocity 10 and weight 83 it will always pick weight. However, the ferocity is a maximum value and can't be beaten.
